	Assumptions/Limitations
===============================

- Anagrams are searched in data.txt file. In order to search a different text, modify the data.txt file
- Intended to display the ability to implement algorithms. Therefore, not a strong emphasis on user interface.
- I list the execution time for presorting at the top, and searching time for each search with the results. I do not consider the 
  presorting time to be part of the final execution time. The reason being is that presorting is only done once, when you do end up searching for an anagram n times for 
  n > 1, it will only presort once and search n times. Which is why presorting is a more efficient method than brute force as the search time for presorting technique is faster than brute force.
- yes/no option is case sensitive in all programs, so make sure to enter 'no' or 'yes'. ONLY 'no' will terminate the program, any other
  other string other than 'no' will continue the program

    Compiling and Running
===============================

*** Type 'make' to compile all questions
*** Type 'make del' to remove all executibles from the bin folder

-> To run anagram Bruteforce program, type: bin/Anagram_BruteForce

-> To run anagram Bruteforce program, type: bin/Anagram_PreSorting
